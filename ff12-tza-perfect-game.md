 # Intro

This guide covers everything needed for a perfect game. This guide's definition is:

- Each bazaar item unlocked at least once
- All non-repeatable treasure obtained
- Order of Ambrosia
- At least one of every equipment obtained without buying it (when possible; bazaar is okay and buying extras is okay)
- Bestiary second pages complete
- Not necessarily the earliest opportunities
    - My first recommendation for this would be [xAshe10x's video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQMTNO6Wnog)

If this is your first time playing, then the guide will be hard to follow. This is meant for someone who's relatively familiar with the game.

For the bazaar in particular, deviating from the guide can easily result in losing track of things. It is expected that the guide is followed wholly.

 ## Motivation

There are many references out there, including the wiki and individual references for treasures, the bazaar, equipment, rare game, and more. However, there's nothing that combines these into a single chronological format. Perhaps video walkthroughs, but they're hard to follow along with at your own pace and to search, plus have a different definition of perfect game.

Rather than cross-referencing five different guides every time I get to the next area, I've done that work in advance. I started by listing story, sidequest, hunt, and treasure information, which is basically a regular walkthrough plus noting all of the noteworthy treasures along the way. Then I went through the rare game, loot, bazaar, and equipment, sprinkling in each one where it belonged. The result is something that can be read without needing to go look up things along the way.

Finally, making my own guide allows me to include personal preferences (e.g., jobs) so that I don't have to research or look them up as I play through.

 ## Format

The information is presented minimally. Look elsewhere for explanations. The goal is to present the necessary information that isn't as easy to remember, and for it to be easy to follow.

 ## Jobs and Espers

The guide contains specific job and esper assignments. Feel free to use your own, or use these if you don't like picking for yourself. You'll notice that these aren't even my choices, they're xAshe10x's.

 # Perfect Game

 ## Equipment

A \* beside an equipment name means this is the easiest source apart from a shop purchase. However, there might be earlier opportunities listed. In short, a \* means you should get this equipment now if you don't have it. No \* means that it can be skipped if desired.

A \*\* beside an equipment name means this is the easiest **repeatable** source, but that there's an easier source for just 1. This is outside the scope of the guide, but is provided as a nice gesture for trophy rare game, which don't respawn, making these sources missable.

Equipment not listed is obtained through the bazaar or sidequests.

 ## Loot

Some loot (like High Arcana) will be used in combination selling, where multiple bazaar items will be unlocked at once and the loot in question will count toward all of the unlocked bazaar items intead of only one.

Generally speaking, the guide lists the earliest good loot opportunities and tries to unlock bazaar items as soon as possible without going too far out of your way. Once all the bazaar items involving a specific loot have been unlocked, that loot can be sold freely.

My loot locations and combinations are not ideal, but are sufficient.

Tips:

- Keep loot you shouldn't sell in one place (e.g., above Teleport Stones)
- Don't sell loot from hunt and sidequest rewards until it's time
- Sell exactly the amount listed when unlocking the bazaar item because extras will go to waste

How much loot is saved through combination selling:

- Blood Wool (9)
- Bundle of Feathers (3)
- Chimera Head (2)
- Dark Crystal (10)
- Dark Magicite (3)
- Dark Stone (2)
- Demon Eyeball (2)
- Demon Feather (6)
- Festering Flesh (6)
- Feystone (1)
- Fire Crystal (10)
- Fire Stone (4)
- Gemsteel (2)
- Giant Feather (3)
- High Arcana (4)
- Holy Crystal (17)
- Ice Magicite (4)
- Maggoty Flesh (4)
- Malboro Flower (3)
- Malboro Fruit (4)
- Malboro Vine (2)
- Orichalcum (2)
- Pointed Horn (3)
- Prime Pelt (8)
- Quality Stone (4)
- Ring Wyrm Liver (2)
- Screamroot (3)
- Spiral Incisor (3)
- Succulent Fruit (3)
- Tanned Hide (1)
- Tyrant Hide (2)
- Unpurified Ether (2)
- Water Crystal (9)
- Wind Magicite (6)
- Windslicer Pinion (5)
- Yellow Liquid (1)

Examples:

- You find a piece of loot that hasn't been mentioned yet
    - Option 1: Sell it for extra money
    - Option 2: Check whether it's required later (a few aren't even used at all) and save it to possibly make your life a bit easier in the future
- The guide says to get 5x Example Loot
    - Collect this many and save them until the guide says to sell them
- The guide says 2/3 Example2 Loot
    - Collect 2 Example2 Loot from here and be aware that 3 are needed in total
- You end up with 10x Example Loot
    - Option 1: Sell the extra 5
    - Option 2: Don't sell the extras until the guide is done with the loot
    - Selling is good for extra money, but requires more effort to know how many extras you have
- In a bazaar recipe, the guide says 1x Example Loot (9 more)
    - Sell everything listed in that section at once
    - Resume only selling extras on top of the 9 remaining necessary ones
    - This loot is used for unlocking future bazaar items
- In a bazaar recipe, the guide says 9x Example Loot (done)
    - Sell everything listed in that section at once
    - Sell any future Example Loot obtained

 ## Treasure Notation

- [Location] Item (Spawn%, Obtain% if spawned)

Location can be a direction (north, southeast, etc.) or a reference number to the above map. The Obtain% is left out if 100%, and except where marked, this is only the case for non-respawnable treasures. Unless otherwise specified, don't wear the Diamond Armlet.

Especially earlier on, some treasures are for convenience - the item can be obtained more easily elsewhere, but the ones I found notable are included for the fun of getting items early.

Each chest has a chance to spawn on each area entry. If spawned, it has a chance to contain gil. If it doesn't contain gil, there are two item possibilities (which can be the same item). Without the Diamond Armlet, it's 50/50 which item is picked if not gil. With the Diamond Armlet, the rare item is 5% and the common is 95%.

 ## Rare Game

- Notable drops/steals are listed
- An (R) before an enemy name indicates a rare game
- A (T) before an enemy name indicates a trophy rare game

 ## Rates

Some exact rates might be wrong. Steal rates come from the wiki, which has inconsistencies (e.g., the Tarasque page claiming Hunting Crossbow is a common steal vs. the weapons page claiming it's a rare steal). Feel free to submit a PR with concrete evidence of the correct rate.

Stealing rates:

- 55% normal = 80% with Thief's Cuffs
- 10% normal = 30% with Thief's Cuffs
- 3% normal = 6% with Thief's Cuffs

Drop rates:

- 40% L0 = 45% L1 = 50% L2 = 55% L3
- 25% L0 = 30% L1 = 35% L2 = 40% L3
- 3% L0 = 6% L1 = 9% L2 = 12% L3
- 1% L0 = 2% L1 = 3% L2 = 5% L3
- monograph rates vary

Poach rates:

- 95% for common or 5% for rare

 ## Chaining

- Every 6-10 enemies is a new chain level
- Chain level starts at L0 and goes to L3
- Picking up a piece of loot normally lowers your kill count by 1 (more at higher chain levels), meaning a longer chain until the next level
- A flashing chain number means you can run around and grab all the loot for no penalty
- Monograph drops are not affected by chain level

 ## Trial Mode

- Trial Mode isn't included because it takes all the fun out of obtaining items IMO

 ## Grinding and General Overpoweredness

The guide defers early grinding to Lhusu Mines, and expects the Penelo section to act as some earlier levelling and LP farming as you go around doing things and killing enemies along the way. Early-game opportunities like Dustia and the Burning Bow still work the same way they did in vanilla, though, so that's your choice. In general, the guide doesn't go for big jumps in your party's effectiveness, at least not until after the Dawn Shard. This also means Seitengrat is assumed to be unused.

Do note that the Werewolf enemy no longer drops a Kotetsu. Instead, this weapon is found early on in the Garamsythe Waterway and Werewolf drops a Slasher.

 # Great Crystal

I said no explanations, but this area is special. The area seems thrown together randomly, but there's a method to the madness. [The names are all consistent](http://finalfantasy.istad.org/2013/11/ffxii-giruvegan-map-of-the-great-crystal/), and there's not a ton to know about it:

- The area is a vertical crystal split into 8 levels/floors
- You start on the lower of the middle two levels
- With one exception, way stones transport you up or down a level, while platforms let you traverse that level
- In the upper levels, only 1 out of 2 of each gate can be open at a time
- You can usually figure out where you are based on the area name
- Levels from top to bottom:
    - Kanbhru (Ultima and shortcut way stone XIX)
    - Uldobi (beginning of path down to Omega Mark XII)
    - Sirhru
    - Dhebon (Omega Mark XII and shortcut way stone XX - inactive until XIX is touched)
    - Kabonii (starting point)
    - Bhrum
    - Trahk
    - Jula/Core (story objective)
- Distance from vertical axis:
    - Pis (center)
    - Jilaam (middle)
    - Phullam (edge)
- Cardinal directions:
    - Udii (north)
    - Praa (east)
    - Avaa (south)
    - Pratii (west)
    - A combination of the above (e.g., Pratii'vaa = southwest - AFAICT the closer direction comes first)
- Way stone directions:
    - A (up)
    - Dha (down)
    - Si (side path AFAICT, used only for Omega Mark XII)
    - Ra (shortcut AFAICT, used only for way stones XIX and XX)
- General:
    - Sthaana (gate stone)
    - Vikaari (way stone)
    - Prama (exit, ground according to Wiki)

Examples:

- A Prama Vikaari (way stone up to the exit)
- Sthaana Scorpio (Scorpio gate stone)
- Kabonii Jilaam Pratii'vaa (on Kabonii level, middle distance from axis, to the southwest)
- A Vikaari Dhebon (way stone up to Dhebon level)
- Dha Vikaari Bhrum (way stone down to the Bhrum level)
- Dha Vikaari Sirhru Si (side path way stone down to Sirhru level - beginning of Omega Mark XII path)
